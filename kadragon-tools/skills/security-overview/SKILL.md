description: Scan all GitHub security alerts (Dependabot, Code Scanning, Secret Scanning) across every repo owned by the authenticated user, ensure each repo is cloned locally, and generate a per-repo plan.md with prioritized fix tasks. This skill should be used when the user mentions "security alerts", "vulnerability scanning", "dependabot overview", "code scanning", "secret scanning", "check my repos for vulnerabilities", or "security overview". Trigger even if only one alert type is mentioned — the skill covers all three.

# Security Overview

Scan all GitHub security alerts across the authenticated user's repos, ensure affected repos are cloned locally, and produce per-repo `plan.md` files with prioritized fix tasks.

Respond in the user's language; keep technical artifacts (commits, branches, file paths) in English.

## Execution Model

Single continuous flow: **Discover → Ensure Local → Generate Plans**.

## Phase 1: Discovery

### 1-1. Authenticate and list repos

Verify `gh` is authenticated. If not, stop and suggest `gh auth login`.

```bash
GH_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
gh repo list "${GH_USER}" --json name,url --limit 300 -q '.[] | "\(.name) \(.url)"'
```

### 1-2. Collect Dependabot alerts

Fetch all Dependabot vulnerability alerts in a single paginated GraphQL call. Either execute `scripts/fetch-alerts.sh` directly, or extract the query pattern from it for manual use.

For query structure, field reference, and pagination details, consult **`references/api-patterns.md`** § Dependabot.

### 1-3. Collect Code Scanning and Secret Scanning alerts

For each repo, fetch alerts via REST. Handle expected errors gracefully:

| HTTP Status | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 403/404 | Feature not enabled | Record as "not enabled", skip |

For endpoint details and response fields, consult **`references/api-patterns.md`** § Code Scanning / Secret Scanning.

**Critical**: Always strip the `.secret` field from secret scanning responses to prevent leaking credentials into context.

### 1-4. Present summary

Show a consolidated table of repos with alerts:

| Repo | Dependabot | Code Scanning | Secret Scanning | Total |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| repo-name | 3 (1 HIGH, 2 LOW) | 1 (1 ERROR) | 0 | 4 |

Sort by total descending. Include severity breakdown. Skip repos with zero alerts.

After the table, show overall stats: total repos scanned, repos with/without alerts, breakdown by type and severity.

## Phase 2: Ensure Local Repos

For each repo with alerts, ensure a local clone exists.

### 2-1. Determine workspace directory

Default to the **parent** of the current working directory. If the current directory is not a typical workspace child (e.g., running from home), confirm the target directory with the user before cloning.

```bash
WORKSPACE_DIR=$(dirname "$(pwd)")
```

### 2-2. Check and clone

For each affected repo:
1. Check if `${WORKSPACE_DIR}/${REPO_NAME}` exists.
2. If missing, clone: `gh repo clone ${GH_USER}/${REPO_NAME} "${WORKSPACE_DIR}/${REPO_NAME}"`

Report status: already-local repos vs newly-cloned repos.

## Phase 3: Generate plan.md

Write a **separate** `plan.md` into **each affected repo's root directory**. Do NOT create a single consolidated file.

### 3-1. Read code context

Before writing fix plans, read relevant files in each repo:

- **Dependabot**: Read dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) for current versions. Skip lock files.
- **Code Scanning**: Read the flagged file at reported line range (+-5 lines). If file is deleted, mark alert as stale.
- **Secret Scanning**: Note alert type and location. Do NOT read or display secret values.

### 3-2. Write plan.md

For the complete template, formatting rules, severity ordering, and idempotency behavior, consult **`references/plan-template.md`**.

Key rules:
- Each `- [ ]` is one atomic, actionable fix.
- Order by severity: CRITICAL > HIGH > MODERATE > LOW.
- Omit empty sections.
- If plan.md exists with a `## Security Fixes` section, **replace** that section only (preserve other content).

### 3-3. Present result

After generating all files, show a summary table with repo, path, and item count. Include total items and suggest a next step.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `gh` not authenticated | Stop, suggest `gh auth login` |
| Rate limited | Report progress, suggest waiting or reducing scope |
| Permission denied on repos | Report skipped repos, continue |
| Clone fails | Report error, continue with other repos |

## Resources

### Scripts

- **`scripts/fetch-alerts.sh`** — Standalone script to collect all three alert types. Outputs structured JSON to a scan directory. Execute directly or read for query patterns.

### Reference Files

- **`references/api-patterns.md`** — GraphQL/REST query details, response field reference, error handling patterns, rate limiting guidance.
- **`references/plan-template.md`** — plan.md template, formatting rules, severity ordering, idempotency, and example output.
